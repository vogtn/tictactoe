####The purpose of this app is to create a single-player game of Tic-Tac-Toe,  this utilizes: 

   *javascript
   
   *CSS
   
   *HTML(Bootstrap)
   
   *jQuery
   
   *JSON

#####Work In Progress:
1. Finish win conditons. As of now, there are place-holder win conditions when the array of user choices matches simple win conditions [1,2,3].
This is the equivalent of the first row being filled with the user choice.  
2. Create A.I. moves. These will have to listen to onclick events, and then output a choice based on the user choice. 
The grid is as follows:

1,2,3

4,5,6,

7,8,9
